    ------------------------GALACTIC BLAST GAME----------------------
        Welcome to Galactic Blast, an exciting arcade-style shooter game 
    where you defend Earth from waves of alien invaders. Control your 
    spaceship using the arrow keys and fire bullets with the "space bar" to 
    destroy the aliens. The aliens move horizontally and descend towards the bottom 
    each time they reach the screen's edge. You have three lives, so dodge enemy 
    fire carefully and prevent the aliens from attacking you, the player.

        GAME INTERFACE
        The game has three main windows: the main menu, the actual game, and the save score & player name screen.
        In the main menu, there are two buttons: one is START GAME, which, when clicked, will start the game, 
    and the other is SCOREBOARD, which, when clicked, will display all the scores achieved by players, their names, 
    and the date the scores were obtained.
    
        HOW TO PLAY
        At the start of the game, the player will have 3 lives and 1 minute 30 seconds (90 seconds) to accumulate as 
    many points as possible while being attacked by aliens. An alien will attack every 5 seconds, randomly chosen. 
    The player earns points by shooting aliens with bullets; aliens also shoot bullets back at the player. 
    Hitting an alien earns the player 10 points, while being hit by an alien causes the player to lose one of their 3 lives. 
    If the player loses all 3 lives or the timer runs out, the game will proceed to the final window where the player can 
    see their score and enter their name, which will then be saved in "scores.txt".
