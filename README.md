    ------------------------GALACTIC BLAST GAME----------------------
        Welcome to Galactic Blast, an exciting arcade-style shooter game 
    where you defend Earth from waves of alien invaders. Control your 
    spaceship using the arrow keys and fire bullets with the "space bar" to 
    destroy the aliens. The aliens move horizontally and descend towards the bottom 
    each time they reach the screen's edge. You have three lives, so dodge enemy 
    fire carefully and prevent the aliens from attacking you, the player.

        GAME INTERFACE
        The game has three main windows: the main menu, the actual game, and the save score & player name screen.
        In the main menu, there are two buttons: one is __START GAME__, which, when clicked, will start the game, 
    and the other is SCOREBOARD, which, when clicked, will display all the scores achieved by players, their names, 
    and the date the scores were obtained.
